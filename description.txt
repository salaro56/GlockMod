Merry Christmas! And happy holidays!
This mod is an entire content mod based on an old inside joke my friend had with another one of his friends.
This year I thought I'd take the one thing he made and make something amazing out of it for him, tho his friend never got to enjoy what RockmanSolid made,
I sure hope that RockmanSolid will enjoy every minute of this mod that I made for him.

This mod includes;
- New weapons including a weapon that upgrades with you
- New damage class
- New armour
- New mobs
- New Prefixes
- And more!

Thank you all so much for playing and enjoying the mod! It means a lot to me!

This mod is still in early access and will see frequent updates until I can finish all of my planned content!
Feel free to leave suggestions for items that you want to see added to the mod in the discord server for the mod.
This mod isn't done and I'll be continuing to add stuff to it even once I'm done my planned content!
